- Change cursor while `isBeingBuilt` is true
- Add end shapes for dead reckon and bearing lines
- Add some hierarchy of elements and disallow deleting elements with children
- Implement `isInArea` for dead reckon and bearing
- SailAway maps show the lat and long at the current view-port extremes.  Add ability to specify lat / long at 2 horizontal / vertical points on the loaded map.  Then, by dividing by the number of pixels and then multiplying by the current pixel you can find out any lat / long on that map screenshot
