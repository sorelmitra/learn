The makefiles shown here are for a case where you have a web app that has a complex src directory structure, and you're working in some subdirectory of the main src directory. This subdirectory is called 'srcdir' here.

You need to:
- copy the makefile.srcdir into your srcdir, and remove the ".srcdir" extension
- copy the makefile.*.rootdir into your main src directory (which would be a parent of srcdir), and remove the ".rootdir" extension
- update the paths in makefile.srcdir to point to your main src directory
- rename if needed and copy the makefile.anchor to your home Documents directory
- update if needed makefile.config and the rest of the makefiles with respect to your particular setup
