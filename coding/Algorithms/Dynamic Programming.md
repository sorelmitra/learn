# Overview and Disambiguation

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and an algorithmic paradigm. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950's and has found numerous applications.

There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for **dynamic programming** to be applicable: **optimal substructure** and **overlapping sub-problems**. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to *non-overlapping sub-problems*, the strategy is called *divide and conquer* instead.[1] This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.

Origin of the name: Bellman worked at the RAND Corporation in 1950, and had a boss that hated "research".  So he had to come with a name for the multistage decision processes he was working on, specifically for planning activities.  So he used "programming" in the sense of "planning", and added "dynamic" to create a cool name umbrella that no stupid boss could object to.
