# Finance and Fintech Glossary

## General

**disbursement** := A payment to an individual or entity from a private or public fund, such as money paid into a business' operating budget, the delivery of a loan amount to a borrower, or a dividend to shareholders.  (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disbursement.asp)

**escrow** := A financial agreement whereby an asset or money is held by a third party on behalf of two other parties that are in the process of completing a transaction.  It provides protection during transactions, but increases fees.

**escrow agent** := A person or entity that holds property in trust for third parties while a transaction is finalized or a disagreement is resolved.

**capital market** := Where savings and investments are channeled between suppliers and those in need. Suppliers are people or institutions with capital to lend or invest and typically include banks and investors.

**automated clearing house (ACH) network** := A system in which funds are electronically transferred from one party to another. ACH transfers allow for safe money transfers online, such as for direct deposits or bill paying.

**same-day ACH** := An improvement to the ACH network that allows the processing of credit, debit, and return transactions several times a day.

**ACH file** := A file that supports ACH transfers, and that obeys to a specific format (https://achdevguide.nacha.org/ach-file-overview)

**KYC** := Know Your Customer. A regulatory requirement that banks, fintechs, and other financial institutions need to fulfill by identifying their customers before opening an account. KYC verification helps financial services businesses put a face and name to their customers, a central part of preventing online fraud and financial crimes and complying with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

**KYB** := Know Your Business. A requirement that involves gathering information about a business, including its ownership structure, beneficial owners, and related parties. Financial institutions and service providers conduct KYB compliance and checks to verify identity and assess risks associated with business entities. This process helps ensure that they are engaging in legitimate business relationships and mitigates the risk of money laundering, fraud, or other illicit activities.

**KYT** := Know Your Transaction. The monitoring and analysis of transactions to detect and prevent suspicious or unlawful activities. This involves keeping an eye on transactional behavior, including transaction amounts, frequency, and parties involved, to identify any possible warning signs. By monitoring transactions in real-time, financial institutions can quickly identify suspicious activities and take necessary action to minimize risks.

## Loans

**loan origination** := The process by which a borrower applies for a new loan, and a lender processes that application. Origination generally includes all the steps from taking a loan application up to disbursal of funds (or declining the application).

**loan proceeds** := Funds disbursed by a lender, less any origination and processing fees.  May be sent directly to the borrower or to an authorized third party who takes custody of the money and applies it to expense.  (https://www.smartcapitalmind.com/what-are-loan-proceeds.htm)

**amortized loan** := A type of loan with scheduled, periodic payments that are applied to both the loan's principal amount and the interest accrued. An amortized loan payment first pays off the relevant interest expense for the period, after which the remainder of the payment is put toward reducing the principal amount. Common amortized loans include auto loans, home loans, and personal loans from a bank for small projects or debt consolidation.

**loan amortization** := The split between how much of your loan payment goes toward principal vs. interest.

**lump-sum payment** := A monetary sum paid in one single payment instead of allocated into installments.

**loan prepay** := Pay extra toward the loan principal to help pay your loan off sooner and save money on interest.

**loan recasting** := The process of prepaying a loan and re-amortizing it with the smaller balance and lower monthly payments.

**loan re-amortization** := Loan recasting.

**loan servicing** := The administrative aspects of a loan from the time the proceeds are dispersed to the borrower until the loan is paid off. Loan servicing includes:

- Sending monthly payment statements
- Collecting monthly payments
- Maintaining records of payments and balances
- Collecting and paying taxes and insurance (and managing escrow funds)
- Remitting funds to the note holder
- Following up on any delinquencies.

Loan servicing can be carried out by:

- The bank or financial institution that issued the loans
- A non-bank entity specializing in loan servicing
- A third-party vendor for the lending institution

## Equipment, incl. Solar Panels

**solar loan re-amortization** := You can use the (US) 30% federal solar tax credit as a lump sum, and re-amortize your loan, roughly around the 18 month mark.

**power purchase agreement (PPA)** := is a contractual agreement between energy buyers and sellers. They come together and agree to buy and sell an amount of energy which is or will be generated by a renewable asset. PPAs are usually signed for a long-term period between 10-20 years.  'Offtaker' is another name for energy buyer, as are 'generator', an 'asset owner' or an 'investor'.

**third-party ownership (TPO)** := The process by which a system is owned, installed and maintained by a third-party.  In this ownership model, homeowners enter into a PPA or may choose to lease the equipment from the third party.

## Payments

**customer** := The one who wishes to make an online payment in return for a product or service.

**end user** := See _customer_.

**merchant** := The provider of the product or service, be it online or local.

**payment** := While there may be various interpretations among FinTech professionals, at its core, online payments – particularly in the world of digital commerce – primarily refer to the transaction-related aspect of transfer of funds, for instance, making a purchase or applying a charge.

**payout** := On the other hand, payouts focus on how the funds collected in a payment are actually settled, i.e. ”paid out” to the ultimate beneficiaries. For example, in an online transaction on UberEats for a $15 sandwich, the payment processed could be split into multiple tranches allocated to the restaurant, the delivery partner, and pay fact/payment gateway commissions.

**payment method** := The way customers prefer to pay for goods or services.  This differs around the world.  Some examples:

- Markets with high card penetration, such as the US and the UK, have seen a significant shift toward digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, which offer more security and convenience.

	- Tap to pay is a wireless way for customers to pay at a point of sale (POS) terminal or card reader that uses short-range wireless near-field communication (NFC) – a specialised type of radio-frequency identification technology. Increasingly, tap-to-pay is becoming a preferred payment method for transactions of all kinds, making it a priority for businesses that want to offer a competitive, technology-forward payment experience to customers.

- In markets like Germany and Malaysia, where card use is much lower, bank-based methods are strongly preferred and trusted for online purchases. The banking networks in these markets typically offer a faster and more secure checkout experience where users can authorize a payment using their online banking credentials.

- In economies with a large un-banked population, such as Mexico and Indonesia, popular payment methods allow customers to pay for online goods with cash using vouchers.

**issuer** := The bank or provider which issued the payment method to the customer is termed as Issuer or Issuing Bank.

**acquirer** := The bank where the _merchant_ has the account where it receives payments from customers.

**network** := The protocol that helps to connect Issuing and Acquiring banks, e.g. MasterCard, Visa, American Express which are international acquirers. Each country might also have its own local card networks, such as UnionPay for China, Rupay for India, and Cartes Bancaires for France.

**scheme** := A payment scheme, also known as a payment system, is a framework for processing payments. It consists of the necessary technical infrastructure plus a set of rules that service users must follow. Common payment schemes include payment cards, e-wallets and buy now pay later payment schemes such as Klarna. 

**payment system** := See _scheme_.

**payment processor** := A system that facilitates financial transactions, commonly employed by a merchant, to handle transactions with customers from various channels such as credit cards and debit cards or bank accounts. E.g., PayPal, Authorize.net, Stripe.

**payment gateway** := Either the same as a _payment processor_ ([1], [2]), or there are some differences [5].

**PCI** := Payment card industry.

**PCI compliance** := PCI compliance is a set of security standards for businesses that process, store or transmit credit card information.

**payment terminal** := A device that allows payments with a card.

**POS device** := See _payment terminal_.

**payment terminal pairing** := The action of connecting and configuring a _payment terminal_ to a computing device (e.g. laptop, tablet). This is typically achieved via USB or Bluetooth.

**RTP** := Real Time Payments. It is a payment method where funds are transferred instantly to the contractor's account, providing quick access to the payout.

## Payment Life-cycle

**customer's intent to pay** := The customer finalizes the shopping cart and attempts to start the payment session. Typically, this functionality is supported through a server API named session API or payments API by most leading processors.

**payment data collection** := Upon the _customers' intent to pay_, the payment methods need to be displayed to the user, and the customer card data needs to be processed. Most payment processors provide this functionality through an SDK which collects the customer card data and sends it to the payment processor servers. Refer to PCI compliance in the above section to understand the need for an SDK in accepting card information.

**payment authentication** := In certain countries (such as European Union), which mandates Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the customer gets redirected to the Issuer to complete authentication. In markets such as the United States, this step is optional. This step is significant while dealing with disputes, explained in Step 6. Payment authentication happens through 3DS1.0 or 3DS2.0 for cards by requesting the customer for an additional factor of authentication, which may be a password.

**payment authorization** := The process by which the payment is confirmed by the customer's bank after the verification of the availability of funds or credit and internal risk check. This step is very crucial since this is the final confirmation that the funds are available in the customer's account.

**payment status validation** := The process by which the status of the payment is updated upon its completion, and the corresponding success/ failure page is displayed to the customer. Generally, there are three means by which the status is validated:

- Payment status API: Query the payment status through a server API using the respective payment identifier.

- Redirection: Upon completion of payment, the customer will get redirected to your domain with the payment status in the query params. Most processors provide the option of configuring such a URL through the dashboard interface or providing the URL as a parameter in the server API mentioned in Step 1.

- WebHooks: WebHooks are automatic server-to-server notifications triggered from the payment processor's server to your server every time the payment status updates. You can configure the WebHook endpoint in the dashboard interface of the payment processor and subscribe for WebHooks events you wish to receive.

**dispute** := A consumer protection means, where a customer files a chargeback claim to the bank stating that the payment was not intended. While cardholders often have extended dispute filing periods of 60-120 days after the transaction or order delivery, merchants, on the other hand, must deal with shorter turnaround windows. If the dispute goes in favor of the customer, in the case of authenticated transactions (Step 3), the liability of the dispute is absorbed by the _issuer_; if the transaction is not authenticated through the _issuer_, the _merchant_ shall bear the cost of the dispute. In general are three kinds of causes for disputes:

- Merchant error may occur due to customer dissatisfaction with the product, shipping issues, or failure to cancel product subscriptions at the right time.

- Criminal fraud may occur due to a customer's stolen or compromised card details, leading to illegitimate purchases.

- Friendly fraud happens when a cardholder misuses the chargeback process, either as an intentional attempt to get something for free or an innocent misunderstanding. Delayed refunds or poor response from customer service could also result in friendly fraud.

**refund** := The process by which the the value of a payment is returned in the customer's account. Refunds may be due to various business use cases, such as the return of a product, the customer canceling a booking, or the customer raising a dispute (Step 6) against the transaction.

- **reversal transaction** := A process that is similar to a _refund_, the difference being that the reversal occurs before the funds have fully entered your account, and can be initiated by either the cardholder, the merchant, the card network, or the issuing or acquiring bank. A reversal can be completed a lot more quickly than a refund, which avoids interchange fees and is a lot less disruptive for both merchant and customer.

**settlement** := The process of transferring funds from a cardholder to a merchant. More specifically, it's the transfer of funds from the _issuer_ to the _acquirer_, usually via the _payment processor_. All payments received from the customers are consolidated and transferred to the merchant's account at a specific frequency. The settlement amount (for a specific period) would be the net of total payments from all customers, minus payment processor fee minus total refunds issued to customers.

**trade date** := Month, day, and year that an order is executed in the market.

**T** := The _trade date_.

**settlement date** := The date when a trade is considered final.

**settlement period** := The time between the _trade date_ and the settlement date.

**T+3** := A settlement period that lasts 3 business days after _T_. For many years, the trade settlement period was five days. Then in 1993, the SEC changed the settlement period for most securities transactions from five to three business days—which is known as T+3.

**T+2** := A settlement period that lasts 2 business days after _T_, which was introduced in March, 2017.

**T+1** := A settlement period that lasts 1 business day after _T_, which was introduced in May, 2024.

## Subscriptions

**proration** := Subscription where the customer is charged a percentage of a subscription's cost to reflect partial use.  E.g. if a customer upgrades from a 10 USD per month plan to a 20 USD option, they're charged prorated amounts for the time spent on each option.
