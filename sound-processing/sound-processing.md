# Basic Sound Processing on a Mac

Install the following:

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) for recording and editing sounds.
* [FFMpeg](https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/installing-ffmpeg) for exporting AAC files from Audacity.
* [BlackHole](http://existential.audio/blackhole) for routing Mac's sound output to a device you can record from.

To record from a playback on your Mac, e.g. YouTube:

* Set your Mac's sound output to BlackHole.
* Set BlackHole volume to maximum (or some other preferred value).
* Un-mute MicDrop!
* Open Audacity -> Choose BlackHole as the recording device -> Hit Record.
* Start your playback.  You won't hear anything but should see it in Audacity.
* Stop playback and recording when done.
* Revert the Mac to your default sound output.
* Save, edit, etc. in Audacity.


# Ringtones

## iPhone

* Get your sound file saved in the AAC / M4A format with the `m4r` extension.
* Connect your iPhone to the Mac, open it in Finder.
* In Finder, drag the `m4r` file to iPhone's General tab.
* Use the new ringtone on the iPhone.

(The `metro.m4r` ringtone I recorded from [14 Sony Ericsson W810i Mobile Phone Ringtones from 2006](https://youtu.be/zYZ05LD5Nxg).)
