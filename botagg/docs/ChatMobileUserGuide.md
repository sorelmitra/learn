# Introduction

The Chat Mobile application is a demo chat app that talks to the Chat API.

# Overview

Currently the app works as a basic messenger, as shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1).
It registers with Chat API server in order to receive messages posted by others.

It allows you to:

- Type a message that's being sent on ENTER
- Receive a message from Chat API Server
- Display the typed and received messages in a scrollable list
- Handle the animations and maintaining the scroll position when software keyboard is toggled
- Show different colors and styles for the incoming/outgoing messages:
	- `DATE >` for the outgoing messages
	- `< DATE` for the incoming messages
