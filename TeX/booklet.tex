% This code will take book.pdf and produce a booklet version of it.
% It assumes the book.pdf page size is small enough so that it fits the layout 
% that we're using.

% pdfpages options:

% pages=- include all original pages
% nup=2x1 place two pages on a row
% noautoscale keep original page dimensions, otherwise they will scale to fit new page
% frame draw a frame around every original page
% signature*=8 organize pages in 8 pages booklets
% landscape new page will be landscape
% angle=180 not sure what it means, but works.
% delta=0 1cm introduces some separation between pages. If you don't need it, delete it.

% This assumes that you will use double side printing.

\includepdf[pages=-, nup=2x1, noautoscale, 
            frame, signature*=8, landscape, 
            angle=180, delta=0 1cm]{book}
