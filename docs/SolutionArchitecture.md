# Overview

BotAgg is a cloud/on premise demo solution for some technologies that I learned, also aiming to provide a demo platform where visitors can discuss with a chat bot and a web app where chat bot owners can administer their bots.

This is what is currently implemented:

* **Chat API**. This is a chat RESTful API that allows posting messages
* **Chat Mobile**. This is a mobile app where the visitors can write messages
