-------------

This project shows the basics of using automake and autoconf for C++ projects.
It is a 'deep' project, meaning that it has source code organised into
sub-projects. This is not well-explained normally, but it is essential for
properly organised source code.

This project accompanies the 'Using autoconf and automake with C++' document at
http://www.openismus.com/documents/linux/automake/automake.shtml
